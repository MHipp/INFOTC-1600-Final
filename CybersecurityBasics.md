## **Protecting Yourself Online**

### **Strong Passwords**
- **Use Complex Passwords**: Combine letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Avoid Common Words**: Stay clear of easily guessable passwords like "123456" or "password".
- **Use a Password Manager**: Tools like Bitwarden or 1Password can generate and store strong passwords securely.

### **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring two forms of identification before granting access to an account.

### **Regular Software Updates**
Keep your operating system and software updated. These updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities.

### **Avoiding Phishing Scams**
- **Verify Emails**: Be cautious of emails requesting personal information. Verify the sender's authenticity.
- **Donâ€™t Click Suspicious Links**: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.

### **Secure Wi-Fi Use**
- **Use Secure Networks**: Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for an added security layer.
- **Change Default Router Settings**: Modify the default username and password to something more secure.

### **Regular Backups**
Regularly back up important data to an external drive or cloud service. This can be a lifesaver in case of data loss or ransomware attacks.
